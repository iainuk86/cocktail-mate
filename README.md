# 🍸 Cocktail Mate 🍸

Cocktail Mate is a web service providing great recipes and cocktail advice.  
It was built with an E-commerce style and was a great way for me to learn the Vue framework.

# ⚒️ Implementation ⚒️
Started life as a traditional Bootstrap / HTML / CSS / JS web template.  
It was then migrated for use in a Spring Boot app, making use of Thymeleaf templates.  
Now it has been migrated to use mainly client-side rendering with the Vue framework.  

# 🔜 Coming Soon ⚠️
- Implement an AI Chatbot to receive various prompts and recommend cocktails for the ingredients / weather at hand.
- A more responsive design for mobile users.
